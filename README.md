Roblox's AssetDelivery API [does not correctly utilise CORS](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/cors-error-on-users-api/1614679) making it essentially impossible for a site on a modern web browser to download clothing assets. This tool replaces the website version as C# HttpWebRequests can ignore CORS making the tool functional again with additional features such as replacing the asset background with the default Roblox Clothing Templates.
### Asset Downloader is additionally completely open-source unlike alternative closed-source tools with embedded malware.
